## Analysis overview for McNew et al. 2021 
### Transcriptomic responses of Gal√°pagos finches to avian pox virus infection

### Scripts: 
1) **pox_genex.R** Script to take output of alignment and calcuate differential 
expression and count estimates for each gene. (uses DeSEQ2). Makes PCA and volcano 
plots
2) **clusterProfiler.R** Script to perform gene set enrichment analysis using 
the counts estimated in pox_genex.R
3) **bracken.R** Script to analyze results of kraken/bracken metatranscriptomics. 
Used to test whether pox reads were found within transcriptomic dataset and whether
there were differences in number of pox reads between species/groups.
4) **slide_data.R** Script to analyze leukocyte counts from slide microscopy
