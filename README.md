# Finch response to pox infection 
## Premise: 
### Emerging infectious disease is a problem for both humans and wildlife. 
### In the Galapagos, one introduced virus is avian pox, which causes lesions 
### on the face and feet of birds. These lesions can impede mobility and foraging, 
### and can be particularly damaging to fledglings/nestlings.
